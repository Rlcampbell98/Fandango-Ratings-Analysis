# Fandango-Ratings-Analysis
This repository contains a detailed analysis of Fandango's movie ratings, exploring potential changes in their rating system before and after a critical article published by Walt Hickey in 2015. The project utilizes datasets from two distinct time periods: 2015 and 2016, providing a comparative study to determine if Fandango adjusted its rating practices in response to the critique.
# Key Components:
* Data Exploration: Initial data analysis to understand the structure and key characteristics of the datasets.
* Data Visualization: Kernel density plots and bar charts comparing the distribution and central tendencies of movie ratings across the two years.
* Statistical Analysis: Calculation of mean, median, and mode for each dataset to identify shifts in rating trends.
* Conclusion: Insights and conclusions derived from the comparative analysis regarding the integrity and transparency of Fandangoâ€™s rating system.

This project is particularly useful for those interested in data science, statistical analysis, and transparency in media rating systems. It showcases Python programming skills, particularly in data manipulation, visualization, and analytical reasoning.
